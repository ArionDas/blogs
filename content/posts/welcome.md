## Sample Code Block

Here's a simple example of a neural network in Python:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

class SimpleNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(SimpleNet, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(0.2)
        
    def forward(self, x):
        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.dropout(x)
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

# Create and use the model
model = SimpleNet(784, 128, 10)
print(f"Model parameters: {sum(p.numel() for p in model.parameters())}")
```

## Sample Math Expression

Here's the attention mechanism formula from the Transformer architecture:

$$\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V$$

Where:
- $Q$ is the query matrix
- $K$ is the key matrix  
- $V$ is the value matrix
- $d_k$ is the dimension of the key vectors
